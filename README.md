# Base-workbench

One of the workbench series that I make. Base-workbench is a kind of bolarplaete for anything. For example,

- study or do tutorial
- try some function of JS or other
- want to see some styles with css

Or, you can use static site generator if you want.

## Description

and if you want to deploy(upload to webserver), must set `ftpconfig.json` in project root.
